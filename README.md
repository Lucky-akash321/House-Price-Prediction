![](https://github.com/Lucky-akash321/House-Price-Prediction/blob/main/house.jpg)

## Introduction
House price prediction is a **regression problem** where machine learning models analyze various factors such as location, square footage, number of rooms, and other attributes to estimate **property prices**. This guide walks through the **end-to-end process** of building a machine learning model for predicting house prices.

### Dataset Source
We will use the **Ames Housing Dataset** from **Kaggle**:
ðŸ”— **Dataset Link**: [Ames Housing Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ander289386/ames-housing-dataset)

## Step 1: Understanding the Dataset
### 1.1 Features in the Dataset
The dataset includes **several numerical and categorical features** that affect house prices. Some key features are:

- **Lot Area**: Size of the property in square feet.
- **Year Built**: Year the house was constructed.
- **Total Rooms**: Number of rooms in the house.
- **Garage Area**: Size of the garage in square feet.
- **Basement Area**: Finished basement square footage.
- **Neighborhood**: Categorical feature denoting the house location.
- **Sale Price**: Target variable (house price).

### 1.2 Problem Statement
The goal is to **train a model that accurately predicts house prices based on available features**.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing
### 2.1 Handling Missing Values
- **Drop columns** with excessive missing values.
- Fill missing numerical values with **mean or median**.
- Fill missing categorical values with **mode**.

### 2.2 Encoding Categorical Features
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical features (e.g., `Neighborhood`) into binary columns.
- **Label Encoding**: Convert ordinal categorical features (e.g., `ExterQual`: Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent) into numerical values.

### 2.3 Feature Scaling
- Normalize numerical features using **Min-Max Scaling** or **Standardization**.
- Log-transform skewed features to **reduce variance**.

---

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 3.1 Visualizing Key Features
- **Histogram plots**: Analyze distribution of numerical variables.
- **Correlation heatmaps**: Identify relationships between features.
- **Scatter plots**: Check the impact of `Square Footage`, `Lot Area`, and `Year Built` on house prices.

### 3.2 Detecting and Handling Outliers
- Use **Boxplots** to identify outliers.
- Remove extreme outliers using **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method.

---

## Step 4: Splitting Data for Training & Testing
- Split dataset into **80% training and 20% testing**.
- Use **Stratified Sampling** to ensure fair distribution of property sizes and locations.

---

## Step 5: Choosing Machine Learning Models
### 5.1 Selecting Regression Algorithms
Different ML models can be used for house price prediction:

1. **Linear Regression** (Baseline Model)
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
5. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for deep learning approach**

### 5.2 Model Training
- Train multiple models and compare their performance.
- Optimize hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.

---

## Step 6: Model Evaluation
### 6.1 Performance Metrics
Evaluate the model using **regression metrics**:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average prediction error.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE, easier to interpret.
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Measures model accuracy (1 = perfect model, 0 = random prediction).

### 6.2 Cross-Validation
- Use **K-Fold Cross-Validation** to assess model stability.
- Compare multiple models based on their **average RMSE**.

---

## Step 7: Feature Importance Analysis
- **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Identify key features influencing house prices.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**: Explain model predictions for individual houses.

---

## Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize **Random Forest/XGBoost/ANN parameters** for better accuracy.
- Use **Grid Search** or **Bayesian Optimization** for parameter tuning.

---

## Step 9: Deploying the Model
### 9.1 Saving the Trained Model
- Save the model using **Pickle (.pkl) or Joblib** for deployment.

### 9.2 Deploying as a Web App
- **Flask/FastAPI**: Create an API endpoint for house price predictions.
- **Streamlit**: Build an interactive web application for users.

### 9.3 Hosting the Model
- Deploy on **AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, or Azure**.

---

## Step 10: Continuous Learning & Improvement
### 10.1 Model Updates
- Regularly update the model with **new property listings**.
- Retrain using **real-time housing market data**.

### 10.2 Explainability & Interpretability
- Use **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** for better understanding.
- Monitor for **model bias** based on location/neighborhood.

---

## Conclusion
This guide provides a **step-by-step approach** to predicting **house prices** using **machine learning**. With proper **feature engineering, model selection, and deployment**, an accurate and scalable house price prediction system can be built.
